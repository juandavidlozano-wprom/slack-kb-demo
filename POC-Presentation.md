# AI-Powered Slack Bot: Demo & Business Value

---

## Why We Built This

Fixing bugs and troubleshooting issues is a necessary part of software and data engineering—but it’s not value-added work. It doesn’t create new features, improve our product, or drive revenue. For Polaris and Wpromote, our real value comes from innovation, analytics, and delivering new solutions to clients.

**Non-value-added work:**
- Fixing bugs
- Searching for solutions in documentation
- Repeating manual troubleshooting steps
- Answering the same support questions over and over

**Value-added work:**
- Building new features for Polaris
- Improving analytics and reporting
- Creating new automations
- Delivering insights to clients

## The Solution: Let AI Handle the Bugs

We built a proof-of-concept Slack bot that uses AI to help our team fix bugs faster. Instead of spending time searching for solutions, the bot:
- Reads your question in Slack
- Searches our knowledge base for relevant answers
- Uses OpenAI to summarize and suggest a fix
- Replies instantly in Slack with steps and code

This means:
- Less time spent on repetitive troubleshooting
- More time for innovation and client value
- Faster onboarding for new team members

## Demo Example: Value-Added vs. Non-Value-Added

**Scenario:**
- A data engineer notices Google Ads spend data is missing for a client in the dashboard.

**Old Way (Non-Value-Added):**
1. Manually search documentation and KB articles
2. Run spot-check SQL queries
3. Check Airflow logs, Cloud Run logs, credentials
4. Ask teammates for help
5. Spend 30+ minutes fixing a routine issue

**New Way (Value-Added):**
1. Type `/kb Why is client XYZ’s spend missing for October 10-12?` in Slack
2. Bot instantly replies with:
   - Summary of the issue
   - Recommended troubleshooting steps
   - Example SQL query
   - Links to relevant documentation
3. Engineer fixes the issue in minutes and gets back to building new features

## How It Works (Simple)
- You ask a question in Slack
- Bot finds the answer using AI and our KB
- You get a clear, actionable response—no more searching

---

## Business Impact
- **Faster bug fixes**: Less downtime, happier clients
- **More innovation**: Engineers focus on building, not fixing
- **Scalable support**: AI answers routine questions 24/7
- **Better onboarding**: New hires get instant help

---

## Try It Yourself
- Go to Slack, type `/kb [your question]`
- See how quickly you get an answer!

## The Future
Let’s automate the routine, so our team can focus on what matters: creating value for Polaris and our clients.

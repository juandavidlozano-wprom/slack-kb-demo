## Why We Built This

> ![Bug Fixing Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/bug.png)  
Fixing bugs and troubleshooting issues is a necessary part of software and data engineering—but it’s not value-added work. It doesn’t create new features, improve our product, or drive revenue. For Polaris and Wpromote, our real value comes from innovation, analytics, and delivering new solutions to clients.

**Non-value-added work:**
- ![No Value Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/delete-sign.png) Fixing bugs
- ![Search Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/search.png) Searching for solutions in documentation
- ![Repeat Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/repeat.png) Repeating manual troubleshooting steps
- ![FAQ Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/faq.png) Answering the same support questions over and over

**Value-added work:**
- ![Rocket Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/rocket.png) Building new features for Polaris
- ![Analytics Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/combo-chart.png) Improving analytics and reporting
- ![Automation Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/robot-2.png) Creating new automations
- ![Client Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/conference-call.png) Delivering insights to clients

## The Solution: Let AI Handle the Bugs

![AI Bot Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/artificial-intelligence.png)

We built a proof-of-concept Slack bot that uses AI to help our team fix bugs faster. Instead of spending time searching for solutions, the bot:
- ![Slack Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/slack-new.png) Reads your question in Slack
- ![Book Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/book.png) Searches our knowledge base for relevant answers
- ![OpenAI Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/brain.png) Uses OpenAI to summarize and suggest a fix
- ![Reply Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/filled-message.png) Replies instantly in Slack with steps and code

## Demo Example: Value-Added vs. Non-Value-Added

<!-- Mermaid Comparison Diagram -->

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Non-Value-Added
        A1[Bug fixing]
        A2[Manual troubleshooting]
        A3[Searching docs]
    end
    subgraph Value-Added
        B1[Feature building]
        B2[Analytics & automation]
        B3[Client insights]
    end
    Non-Value-Added -->|Time lost, no new value| C1[ ]
    Value-Added -->|Innovation, growth| C2[ ]
```

|                | Non-Value-Added Work         | Value-Added Work           |
|----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Goal**       | Fixing bugs, troubleshooting | Building new features      |
| **Process**    | Manual search, repeat steps | Automated, AI-powered help |
| **Time Spent** | 30+ min per issue           | <5 min per issue           |
| **Impact**     | No new product value        | Innovation, client value   |

```
+--------------------------+        +--------------------------+
|  Non-Value-Added         |        |   Value-Added            |
|--------------------------|        |--------------------------|
|  Bug fixing              |        |  Feature building        |
|  Manual troubleshooting  |        |  Analytics & automation  |
|  Searching docs          |        |  Client insights         |
+--------------------------+        +--------------------------+
         |                                 |
         v                                 v
   Time lost, no new value         Innovation, growth
```

**Scenario:**
- A data engineer notices Google Ads spend data is missing for a client in the dashboard.

**Old Way (Non-Value-Added):**
1. ![Search Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/search.png) Manually search documentation and KB articles
2. ![SQL Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/database.png) Run spot-check SQL queries
3. ![Logs Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/file.png) Check Airflow logs, Cloud Run logs, credentials
4. ![Help Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/help.png) Ask teammates for help
5. ![Time Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/clock.png) Spend 30+ minutes fixing a routine issue

**New Way (Value-Added):**
1. ![Slack Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/slack-new.png) Type `/kb Why is client XYZ’s spend missing for October 10-12?` in Slack
2. ![Bot Reply Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/filled-message.png) Bot instantly replies with:
   - ![Summary Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/summary-list.png) Summary of the issue
   - ![Steps Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/steps.png) Recommended troubleshooting steps
   - ![SQL Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/database.png) Example SQL query
   - ![Link Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/link.png) Links to relevant documentation
3. ![Rocket Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/rocket.png) Engineer fixes the issue in minutes and gets back to building new features
